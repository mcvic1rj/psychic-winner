## Things to look out for
- These requests are often "too good to be true"
- Piano giveaways along with other items tend to lead to check cashing scams.

## What to do if you responded
- If they asked for alternate email addresses, or phone numbers, immediately cease communication and be on the lookout.
- If any money has been exchanges, immediately report the fraudulent activity
