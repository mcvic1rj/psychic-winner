Information Security oversees the process of removing sources of any technology incident, collecting evidence, addressing vulnerabilities, wiping any compromised data stores, and resuming business operations as soon as possible.

Reportable incidents include malware infections, phishing scams, illegal software, theft of devices with sensitive data, and unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Information Technology streamlined the incident response procedure for the MSU community as part of a multi-year incident response initiative to centralize the universityâ€™s response to sensitive data breaches, network security incidents, and suspicious activity.

## Benefits
Centralized incident response provides a consistent way to handle breaches and incidents and removes the burden of responsibility from campus IT staff to handle and contain incidents themselves. It also helps MSU protect its data and resources.
