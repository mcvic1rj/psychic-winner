Information Security provides static and dynamic code analysis for critical university applications. Web application vulnerability scanning is also conducted quarterly on public MSU web applications.

Code analysis and web application scanning help identify application flaws that can pose significant security concerns. Read more about Secure Code Analysis.

## Benefits
Overall vulnerability testing allows MSU to better combat the rising number of Internet-based attacks. If a vulnerability is discovered, the system owner will be notified by Information Security via a confidential report detailing the risks and ways to resolve the vulnerability.

This program is designed to increase MSUâ€™s overall security by taking preventative measures to reduce risks and respond to vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.
